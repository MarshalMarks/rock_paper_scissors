# Project Summary
This is a simple web project that I am using to learn how to use GitHub integration in Visual Studio Code.

The user can play a game of "Rock Paper Scissors" with the computer. 

HTML, JavaScript, and CSS will be used for this project.

# Gameplay

To make a move, the user clicks one of the buttons labeled "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors". The computer will make a move in response, and the results of this match will be displayed on the screen.

- If the player beats the computer, the player will gain a point.
- If the computer beats the player, the computer will gain a point.
- If the player and the computer pick the same option, that matchup will be a tie and nobody will gain a point.

This game is played on a "best of 5" basis. The first agent to reach 3 points will win the game.

After a game is over, the user can select the "Play again" button to reset the points to 0 and start a new game.
